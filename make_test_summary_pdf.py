"AI-driven testing expands coverage by automating test generation, prioritizing scenarios, "
"and continuously exploring edge cases that human testers often miss. Machine learning models "
"can infer application behavior from code, logs, and usage telemetry to synthesize input variations, "
"data permutations, and UI interaction sequences at scale. This increases mutation and path coverage, "
"reduces human bias in test case selection, and identifies flaky or brittle behaviors earlier. "
"AI can also maintain and adapt tests when the UI or APIs evolve, minimizing manual upkeep. "
"Combined with human oversight, AI accelerates regression detection, improves risk-based prioritization, "
"and surfaces regressions across a wider input space than feasible manually â€” all while enabling "
"developers to focus on high-value exploratory testing and complex scenarios."
